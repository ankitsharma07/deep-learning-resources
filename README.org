* Introduction
I have found many blogs/articles/books/courses around the internet which talks
about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am creating this repository in which
I will mention some ~awesome~ resources scattered around the internet and as I
complete the books, learn from the courses and read the articles, I will update
my learnings alongwith.

This ~repository~ will be a central hub for =learning=.

* Courses

Some of the great courses and their links at a single place.
